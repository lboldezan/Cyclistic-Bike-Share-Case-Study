# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Case-Study

## Introduction
This is my Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Cetification. The R programming language was choose to clean, process, analyse and share my analysis.

## Summary
Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
